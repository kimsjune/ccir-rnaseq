## Plan

1.  Intro to RNA-seq analysis (today)
2.  RNA-seq pt 1
    -   indexing the genome
    -   read alignment
    -   counting
3.  RNA-seq pt 2
    -   differential gene expression with edgeR
4.  RNA-seq pt 3
    -   visualization

## Not within the scope

-   when/why you should or shouldn't do RNA-seq\
-   how to purify RNA and send to sequencing (Toronto/McGill)\
-   budget and design (might cover later)\
-   core facility jobs
    -   RNA-seq library generation
        -   non-core labs don't typically make their own libraries
    -   Illumina sequencing technology (ex. bridge amplification)

## Within the scope

-   You have (or will have) some RNA-seq data to analyze
    -   ie. you have (or will have) some `samples.fq.gz` files
-   how to go from here to PCA, Volcano plots, heatmaps, etc.? 🤔🤔🤔

## Two phases to RNA-seq analysis

+---------------------------------+----------------+---------------------+

+=================================+================+=====================+
| reads :arrow_right: count table | HPC            | -   large file size |

|                                 |                | -   high compute    |

## Working on a high performance computing cluster (HPC)

-   A big challenge to learning bioinformatics is the lack of graphical user interfaces (GUI).\
    - click and drag

-   Instead we have to use the command-line interface (CLI).  
    - we have to type out what we want to do

-   To process `reads` into a `count table`, we need to use a HPC at a remote location.\

## A HPC \@ Waterloo: Graham

![](justin-wan-with-graham-selfie.webp){width="70%"}\

-  it's a big freaking computer  
-  we can't drive over to Waterloo every time  
-  We can log in to `graham` from our computer using `ssh`  

## Logging into `graham` through Terminal/Command Prompt

::: callout-warning
Change `skim823` with your username!
:::

<br>

::: big-code

```{bash echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
ssh skim823@graham.computecanada.ca
```

:::

<br> 

-  Prompts you with "are you sure blah blah?"; type `yes`
-  Prompts with your password; what you type is invisible for security  
-  Prompts you with MFA (*annoying*)  


## Linux terminal basics

::: columns
::: {.column width="30%"}
Basic commands\
- `pwd`\
- `ls`\
- `cd`\
- `cp`\
- `mv`\
- `mkdir`\
- `touch`\
- `rm`\
- `cat`\
- `head`\
- `tail`
:::

::: {.column width="70%"}
Tips\
- `tab` to "auto" complete\
- `ctrl/cmd + c` to abort\
- `ctrl/cmd + a` to move the cursor to the beginning\
- `ctrl/cmd + e` to move the cursor to the end\
- `ctrl/cmd + l` to clear the screen

## Workflow on the HPC side

:::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
![](flowchart.svg)
:::

::: {.column width="60%"}
-   we need at least (and at most) three kinds of files:
    -   `genome.fa` file\
    -   `genes.gtf/.gff` file\
    -   `reads.fq.gz` files\
-   hopefully you got your `reads.fq.gz` from your sequencing core\
-   `genome` is the reference build of your organism
    -   ex. mm10, mm39, hg38
-   `genes` contains coordinates (among others) to all genes of that genome
    -   protein-coding, non-coding, how well annotated?
-   you have to make sure your `genome` and `genes` match

## Downloading these files to our HPC

First, let's create a new directory somewhere to save our files\

<br>

::: big-code

```{bash}
cd /home/$USER/project/$USER
mkdir workshop
cd workshop
```

:::

<br>

Question: what is your current directory?

`wget` is a command we can use to download files over the internet

::: big-code

```{bash}
wget https://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenpath/mm10/bigZips/mm10.fa.gz
wget https://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/gencode/Gencode_mouse/release_M1/gencode.vM1.annotation.gtf.gz
```

:::

## Downloading these files to our HPC

These are our dummy reads (`*.fq.gz`):

-   1% of all reads subsampled to reduce computational cost\
-   `DKO` for double KO cells\
-   `D1` for DMSO treated replicate 1\
-   `L00?` for sequencing lanes
    -   samples are sequenced across different "lanes" on the sequencing machine
        -   to reduce lane bias? idk lol\
    -   you might get pooled reads or not depending on the core/machine setup

<div class=big-code>

```{bash}
wget https://github.com/kimsjune/ccir-bioinformatics2024/tree/main/week1/DKO_D1_L001
wget https://github.com/kimsjune/ccir-bioinformatics2024/tree/main/week1/DKO_D1_L002
wget https://github.com/kimsjune/ccir-bioinformatics2024/tree/main/week1/DKO_D1_L003
wget https://github.com/kimsjune/ccir-bioinformatics2024/tree/main/week1/DKO_D1_L004
```


## Progress so far

:::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
![](flowchart.svg)
:::

::: {.column width="60%"}
-   we got our `reads.fq.gz`, `genome.fa`, and `genes.gtf`
-   next week we will perform `STAR index`
    - necessary to align our reads to the genome
