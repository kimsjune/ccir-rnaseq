## Recap

:::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}

:::

::: {.column width="60%"}
-  last week, we downloaded all the necessary files  
-  we will do our real first "thing"---creating an index
:::

::::

## Setup

::: {.big-code}

```{bash}
# This is a comment; it does not get executed.
# Log in to Graham
ssh skim823@graham.computecanada.ca
```  
<br>
```{bash}
# Remember where we downloaded our files?
cd /home/$USER/project/$USER/workshop
pwd # Check where we are
```

:::

## Unzipping

Our files are `gz`ipped (compressed). So they have to be un-zipped with `gzip`.  

::: {.big-code}

```{bash}
gzip --help
```
<br>
```{bash}
gzip -c mm10.fa.gz
gzip -c gencode.vM1.annotation.gtf.gz
# Are the files there?
ls -l
```

:::

::: {.callout-tip}

-  Use `--help` or `-h` to see a help menu  
-  Use `--version` or `-v` to see if the program is even loaded

:::

## Log in vs. compute node

-  When we `ssh` into `graham`, we are at a **log in** node  
-  To run computationally heavy stuff like indexing a genome, 
we need to submit it as a job to a **compute** node  
    -  or else it will take forever
-  What about the `gzip` thing just now? It's okay for a log in node 
-  We need to write a text file describing our command, then submit it to `slurm`  
    -  `slurm` is a program running on the HPC that manages our requests

## A `slurm` job script header

::: {.big-code}

```{bash}
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH --account=$SLURM_ACCOUNT
#SBATCH --time=1:00:00
#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=12
#SBATCH --mem-per-cpu=16G
#SBATCH --job-name=STAR_index
#SBATCH --output=%x.%j.out
#SBATCH --error=%x.%j.err
```

:::

These lines outline the resources we are requesting:  

-   line 1: a "shebang" line that indicates this is a `bash` script (mandatory)  
-   line 2: our group account name (mandatory)  
-   lines 3-5: we are asking for 12 CPUs, 16G RAM each for 1 hr total  
    -   If our job is not done within 1 hr, tough luck. It will just terminate. 
-   lines 6-8: many programs spit out some metadata about what it's doing and if anything is going wrong into `stdout` and `stderr`, respectively. Custom names for these files.

## Setting our $SLURM_ACCOUNT

Let's set our $SLURM_ACCOUNT `environment variable` so that you can copy & paste code.  

::: big-code

```{bash}
cd /home/$USER/projects && ls
```
<br>
```{bash}
# Append our new environment variable to our settings file
# Don't hit enter before changing "YOUR_GROUP_NAME"
echo export SLURM_ACCOUNT=YOUR_GROUP_NAME >> ~/.bashrc
```
<br>
```{bash}
# This settings file needs to be reloaded
source ~/.bashrc
# Check if SLURM_ACCOUNT is now set
echo $SLURM_ACCOUNT
```

:::

## Indexing with `STAR`

[`STAR`](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3530905/) is a fast splice-aware read alignment program. Designed specifically for mapping RNA-seq reads. Cited some cool 38k times since 2013.  

Other alternatives: [HISAT2](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-019-0201-4), [Kallisto](https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.3519), [Salmon](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5600148/)

::: big-code

```{bash}
STAR --runThreadN 12 --runMode genomeGenerate --genomeDir /home/$USER/project/$USER/workshop/stargenome --genomeFastaFiles /home/$USER/project/$USER/workshop/mm10.fa  --sjdbGTFfile /home/$USER/project/$USER/workshop/gencode.vM1.annotation.gtf --sjdbOverhang 74
```

:::

[STAR manual](https://physiology.med.cornell.edu/faculty/skrabanek/lab/angsd/lecture_notes/STARmanual.pdf)

-  `runThreadN`: running 12 cores in parallel\
-  `runMode`: creating an index\
-  `genomeDir`: where the output (index) will go\
-  `genomeFastaFiles`: path to our reference genome\
-  `sjdbGTFfile`: path to our gene annotation\
-  `sjdbOverhang`: read length - 1


## Full job script

::: big-code
```{bash}
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH --account=$SLURM_ACCOUNT
#SBATCH --time=1:w00:00
#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=12
#SBATCH --mem-per-cpu=16G
#SBATCH --job-name=STAR_index
#SBATCH --output=%x.%j.out
#SBATCH --error=%x.%j.err

STAR --runThreadN 12 --runMode genomeGenerate \
--genomeDir \
/home/$USER/project/$USER/workshop/stargenome \
--genomeFastaFiles \
/home/$USER/project/$USER/workshop/mm10.fa \
--sjdbGTFfile \
/home/$USER/project/$USER/workshop/gencode.vM1.annotation.gtf \
--sjdbOverhang 74
```

:::


## Create and save a job script text file with `nano`


`nano` is a built-in text editor. Use the arrow keys to navigate.

::: big-code

```{bash}
nano index.sh
```
:::

Paste in the full job script, save with `ctrl/cmd + x`, hit `y` to "Save modified buffer", and hit `enter` to confirm "File Name to Write".


## Loading `STAR` with `module`

One of the benefits of these HPCs is that popular programs are pre-installed. They just have to be loaded before we submit our job script. 


::: big-code

```{bash}
# Prompts you to select a version by pressing a number
STAR --version
```
<br>
```{bash}
# or load it directly like this
module load star
```

:::

::: callout-tip

-   Sometimes our module environment has to be right to even load certain programs\
-   `module spider PROGRAM` will tell you how to load certain programs\
-   `module list` shows all active modules\
:::

## Finally running it

::: callout-warning

Always check if your program (as a module) is loaded by running `PROGRAM --version / -v / -V`. If it's not, your job will fail.

:::

::: big-code
```{bash}
STAR --version
```
<br>
```{bash}
sbatch index.sh
```

:::

Check the `slurm` job schedule for your account:

::: big-code

```{bash}
sq
```

## HPCs vs Cloud

These HPCs are **free** like free beer, but you often have to wait for your stuff to run.\

Wait time depends on usage (CPUs, time, memory). `slurm` keeps track of these.\

You'd want to avoid wasteful usage. You can check efficiency by running `seff JOBID`.\

[`slurm` documentation](https://slurm.schedmd.com/documentation.html)\

Frequently used commands: `sbatch`, `sq`, `sacct -b`, `seff`\

On the other hand, cloud services (AWS, Azure, GCP) have no wait times, but functionally not free.
